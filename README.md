# PostyApp Social Posting App

Hi! PostyApp is an essential social media application. I aim to develop it as containing ordinary features for now but I can add new features in time. Below things used;

**Back End**

 - **Spring Boot**
 - Swagger (and also you can see API Endpoint Schema via [this link](https://postyapp-04194dc6a480.herokuapp.com/swagger-ui/index.html#))
 - Spring Security for auth
 - JWT for auth
 
**Front End**

For going to the  front end repository, [click here](https://github.com/mustafakacarr/PostyApp-Social-Posting-App-Front-End).
 - **ReactJS**
 - Redux

  It will store user datas with token in localStorage. 
 
**DevOps**
 - Heroku (For BE deployment)
 - Vercel (For FE deployment)
 - Docker
 - Kubernetes

 And thats all for now. 
 
# Features
- Login and Registration,
- Add, Edit and Delete Post,

Maybe more in time... :)
